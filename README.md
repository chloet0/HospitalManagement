# HospitalManagement
This project showcases an end-to-end relational database and SQL analysis for a fictional hospital management system. It simulates real-world scenarios in healthcare operations using structured queries across multiple datasets. The goal is to extract actionable insights related to patient care, doctor efficiency, financials, and treatment records.

The project is built on a synthetic healthcare dataset that includes the following 5 tables:
  patients – demographic and insurance information
  doctors – staff specialization and professional details
  appointments – patient-doctor visit records
  treatments – treatment details linked to appointments
  billing – payment and invoice records
Each table reflects realistic hospital operations, ideal for showcasing SQL data analysis skills.

What I Learned
  Writing complex joins across 3+ tables
  Using aggregation, grouping, and date functions
  Handling real-world schema relationships (e.g., appointment ↔ billing ↔ treatment)
  Designing insights relevant to business users (finance, admin, HR)
